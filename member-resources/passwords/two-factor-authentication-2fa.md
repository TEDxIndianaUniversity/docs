# 2️⃣ Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)

Often times, sites will require that you input a two-factor authentication code. We utilise Zoho Vault's OneAuth app to store our 2FA codes.

## Prerequisites

* You must already have access to our [password manager](password-manager.md).
* The app may request a push from a director the first time that you use it. Try setting this up when a director is around or available to message.

{% hint style="warning" %}
**NEVER** share 2FA secrets nor 2FA account information with anyone, even someone claiming to be in TEDxIndianaUniversity. Instead, have them contact a director if they need assistance.
{% endhint %}

## Get Started

1. Download OneAuth for [iOS](https://zurl.to/oa\_web\_applebadge), [Android](https://zurl.to/oa\_web\_androidbadge), [macOS](https://zurl.to/oa\_web\_applebadge), or [Windows](https://zurl.to/oa\_web\_msbadge).
2. Search the password manager for "OneAuth (2FA) - Zoho Vault"&#x20;
3. Sign in with these credentials
4. The app may request a 2FA prompt. Ask a director for this.
5. Navigate to the "Authenticator" tab
6. Select the option to "restore" or "sync" OTP secrets
7. Enter the credentials again
8. You should now have access to the auto-updating 2FA secrets
