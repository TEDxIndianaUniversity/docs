## What is a Salon?

At a Salon, attendees watch TED Talks, sometimes host a few speakers (though itâ€™s not required) and have informal discussions about the talks they witnessed. Salons re-engage your community and team during the time between your main TEDx events, and spark discussion on issues of interest to your local community.

## Reasons for Salon Events

* **The discussion:** A critical element of salon is lively discussions, allowing attendees to actively participate in the event. With much smaller audiences than a standard TEDx event, salons bring attendees together in more intimate spaces, and with more chances to get know and exchange ideas as with each other.
* **The single subject:** Having the ability to focus on only one subject creates focused audience and atmosphere.
* **The choice of format:** Salon events range anywhere from dinner party settings to mini standard TEDx events, and anything in between. Itâ€™s up to organizers to decide what size and format is best for their community.
* **Frequency:** Salons are recurring events that offer organizers an exciting way to stay engaged with their communities. Salons can happen between larger standard events, providing a regular touch point for you and your community.
* **The options:** Because emphasis is on discussion in salons, you donâ€™t need to find new speakers; you can discuss TED and TEDx talks that already exist. You also have the option to invite live speakers to your event, too. You have options!
