## Intro

This document is the source of truth. These are the expectations for your upcoming TEDxIndianaUniversity Salon and the questions you should be asking yourself. Think of these as pieces of gold: little tidbits of knowledge that are essential to getting your Salon right. These are the expectation, not the exception. This means that you should be able to concretely answer these core questions. We believe that every one of you is more than capable of achieving these. This is why you‚Äôre a part of TEDxIndianaUniversity. You wouldn't be here if we thought differently.

&#x20;

## Part 1: Your Theme & the Video

¬∑      You should choose a theme like you're putting on a TEDx conference. Why should a busy, tired person care about your Salon topic, or are they there just for the snacks? (Hint: If they're here for the snacks, you're doing something wrong.)

¬∑      Why is this topic essential to be talked about now, by this group of people? People should be demanding to respond and discuss the topic. If it's true _Ideas are Everything_, what makes them care about this idea over all the others in their life?

¬∑      Does your video have gravity? Does it make people want to engage in the conversation? People can watch half-baked Netflix content on their own time. At TEDx, we only want the most inspiring and thought-provoking content.

¬∑      What do you want the audience to take from this conversation? If your answer is "a good time" or "they feel inspired," you obviously haven't thought about your theme enough. This should be tangible. Why do they now care about this topic? Why is it imperative for them to care about this? (Hint: Your discussion should be so fulfilling that people think about it in the shower.)

&#x20;

## Part 2: Discussion & Your Activity

¬∑      If you've thought through the above questions well enough before your Salon, you shouldn't have to put too much energy into getting people to talk. If they aren't interested in talking, maybe that means something was done wrong. The discussion should be so strong that it stands alone: you shouldn't even need an activity (though, still do one).

¬∑      Does your video _actually_ support this kind of discussion? Is your discussion _actually_ supported by your video? How do the selected talks support the conversation? How do they add to it? How can the audience add to the video's commentary? If you're just realizing that your video doesn't do these, it's time revisit part 1 and re-think that :P

¬∑      You should plan to guide the conversation. With any topic that people are salivating to discuss, things will get off topic. You need to recenter it. Your questions should foster conversation without belittling it. Don't ask people, ‚Äúwhat do you think.‚Äù Ask them what change now needs to happen in their lives‚Ä¶ in others‚Äô lives. If you're going to ask a question, the question should have been deeply thought about for a good while... battle tested... making it better than any other question to be asked.

¬∑      How are you as a team going to ensure that everyone has a voice? Everyone has _Ideas Worth Spreading_, but not everyone will be comfortable voicing them in all settings. If someone has an excellent idea worth sharing, how are you going to make sure it's heard? Your Salon may not be a setting someone is naturally comfortable in. What if someone disagrees with the video? Or someone else in the room?

## Part 2.71828 (Part e): Promotion

¬∑      People should walk down the street, see a poster, and want to go to your Salon. Does your Salon name spark interest? A name should be properly descriptive, accurately representing the content of the Salon without confusion; however, it must also be enough to draw people in.

¬∑      When you talk about this Salon with your friends, do you speak with excitement? (Hint: Why should they care if you don‚Äôt seem to?)

&#x20;

## Part 3: Expectations

¬∑      This is a ticketed event from an organization that has hundreds of annual attendees. This event should hold up to that rigor.

¬∑      People are coming to this event thinking of the TEDx brand. Do you represent TEDx in a positive light? How do you present? Does your appearance and attitude match that of an international non-profit?

¬∑      Other teams put in their own time to make this opportunity available to new members. Make them feel like they want to be a part of this project. Why do they want to help you?

¬∑      This event goes on our website. Publicly. Forever. (Hint: Is this work what you want posterity to know is your own?)

¬∑      Your admittance to TEDxIndianaUniversity relies on your performance, care, and crafting of this Salon. You will remain in the organization not if you merely do the Salon but if you _do it well._

¬∑      MOST OF ALL: Are you acting like this is as big of a deal as it is? Not just anyone gets into TEDx. Not just anyone has a platform to share ideas. You‚Äôre expected to treat this Salon with the same care as a conference.

&#x20;

We‚Äôre excited to attend your Salon,

TEDxIndianaUniversity Executive Board
