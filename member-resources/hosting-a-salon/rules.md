## Branding & Marketing

* All salons hosted by TEDxIndianaUniversity must use the branding and naming: "**TEDxIndianaUniversitySalon**" No other name may be used to describe the event.&#x20;
* No sponsor names nor names of organizations with whom you collaborate may appear in the title.&#x20;
* TEDx team members and TEDx speakers can use up to a 60-second excerpt from a TEDx Talk **for non-commercial, social media use only**. These clips must tag the official TEDx account on the respective platform. Find the list of official TED handles [here](https://www.ted.com/participate/organize-a-local-tedx-event/tedx-organizer-guide/branding-promotions/social-media).

## Size

Salons are intended to spark active discussions among smaller groups, so the audience for a Salon event should be significantly smaller than the audience for a standard event.&#x20;

TEDxIndianaUniversity, having attended a TED event, may host more than 100 attendees; however, we recommend a Salon size of less than 200 people to ensure it's distinct from our anual Conference.

***

## Theme

Unlike other TEDx events, salon events may focus on a single subject area, rather than have a broader theme. But each salon event in your series must explore a different subject. (In other words, you can’t organize multiple salons around the same subject.) The themes should not overlap with separate event types, such as [TEDxWomen](https://www.ted.com/participate/organize-a-local-tedx-event/before-you-start/event-types/tedxwomen) or [TEDxYouth](https://www.ted.com/participate/organize-a-local-tedx-event/before-you-start/event-types/youth-event) - these have separate licenses

* If you would like to advertise the theme of the Salon, it may be on the same marketing materials as "**TEDxIndianaUniversitySalon**" but must be visually and semantically separate from the name. For example, you may NOT brand the event as "**TEDxIndianaUniversitySalon Struggles of Biochemistry**." &#x20;

***

## Duration

Unlike other TEDx events, salons are shorter. The entire event should be no more than a half day.

***

## Pricing

If you are only showing existing talks, you may charge a nominal fee to cover your expenses. If you have live speakers, you may charge a higher ticket price.\
\
The ticket price you may charge depends on your [Licensing Tier](https://www.ted.com/participate/organize-a-local-tedx-event/before-you-start/event-types/licensing-tiers). Events organized by a Community tier licensee may charge up to $150 USD per ticket.

## Sponsors & Partnerships



* You cannot have sponsors who sell weapons/ammunition, tobacco/cigarettes or adult-oriented products/services.
* Sponsors cannot be speakers at the TEDx event they’re sponsoring.
* **Sponsors must have no editorial control, no influence over your program curation, and no veto power over your program.**
* You may not approach any sponsors that fall under our [prohibited sponsor](https://www.ted.com/participate/organize-a-local-tedx-event/tedx-organizer-guide/sponsors-finances/prohibited-sponsors-and-industries#h2--prohibited-sponsors) or [prohibited industries](https://www.ted.com/participate/organize-a-local-tedx-event/tedx-organizer-guide/sponsors-finances/prohibited-sponsors-and-industries#h2--prohibited-industries) lists.
* Sponsor logos cannot be displayed on your TEDx stage. You can thank your sponsors in a slide, but the logos cannot remain on the stage for more than a few seconds—or be in any team photos.
* You can mention a sponsor’s specific contribution to your event in your social media channels, including Twitter, Facebook and Instagram, by tagging their social media accounts, using their hashtag or including their organization name in an image caption.
* You or your sponsor can produce a video about the sponsor’s contribution to your event, to be shared on your or the sponsor’s social media channels. This **must be produced with TEDxIndianaUniversity Executive Board's approval** of the way your collaboration is presented.
* You cannot share sponsor content that is unrelated to your TEDx event, e.g. a sponsor’s marketing campaign, product announcements, etc.
* You cannot post a sponsor logo (or logos) on its own, but logos may be included if visible in an event photo or other creative material.

***

## Funding

* You may not use your event to make money.
* You may not use your event to raise funds for charities or other organizations.
* TEDx events cannot organize separate ticketed TEDx-branded fundraising events or use crowdfunding platforms -- such as IndieGoGo, Kickstarter, or other local platforms -- to raise money for any aspect of a TEDx event.

## Media & Recording

* All of your speakers, performers, and other stage presenters must sign our [speaker release form](https://pb-assets.tedcdn.com/system/baubles/files/000/006/485/original/TEDx\_Speaker\_Release.doc?1527633627), giving TED and others the right to edit and distribute video of their presentation.
* You may create video content specific to your TEDx event. Any content - whether audio or video - including documentaries - must abide by the following:
  * No use of the TED and/or plain TEDx logos without your unique location qualifier
  * No remixing or re-editing of TEDx Talks
  * No filming is permitted inside the theatre except the filming of your TEDx Talks; the only film crew that is allowed into the theater is the designated crew recording the TEDx Talks
  * You can shoot b-roll in break areas, but not inside the theatre
* Photos of TEDx events must be released under a Creative Commons license ("Attribution - NonCommercial - NonDerivative"), so they can be freely shared and reposted.
* You may not create podcasts based on your TEDx series and content.
* The sponsor logos must appear smaller than the TEDxIndianaUniversity logo. Sponsor logos may only be shown on a single slide at the beginning and end of each edited video. If you are unable to edit these image files, you may recreate the layout in your image/slide editor of choice.
* TEDx Talk videos should be uploaded to YouTube through the TED Media Uploader and shared from the TEDx YouTube channel through an embed.&#x20;
* Talks cannot be uploaded to any other platforms or channels. Organizers may not share the video file with the speakers directly, instead, the link to their talk should be shared.
* You must confirm that all the images, music and video clips used in your speakers' presentations are cleared for distribution on YouTube. Securing rights to any copyrighted materials is entirely the responsibility of the TEDx organizer.
