# ðŸ”‘ Password Manager

We use a password manager to keep our digital accounts safe. (And let's be honest... who actually remembers all those passwords?)&#x20;

## Installing the Password Manager

We utilise Bitwarden as our Password Manager, which has extensions for most major browsers and devices. You can [download the extensions from their website](https://bitwarden.com/download/).

## How do I log in?

This is a great question! And this depends on whether you're a general member or a director. General members should ask their director for the information to gain access to the password manager. Directors should have received the information from the previous directors. If you haven't, be sure to talk with the president to get you that information.

For security purposes, we don't publish the endpoint or login information of our password manager on this site.
