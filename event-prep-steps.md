# âœ… Event Prep Steps

## Event Prep Checklist

1. Decide a date and time for the event. _**Be sure it's 3+ weeks out from now.**_
2. Request a location for your event: [room-reservations.md](team-resources/operations/room-reservations.md "mention")
   1. Need guidance? Have questions? Message Ops by [posting in the Operations Channel](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/channel/19%3A4aea2c986d9b484e9133233e399df69d%40thread.tacv2/Operations?groupId=13a3570e-1587-4b29-9596-18efe1cf3500\&tenantId=1113be34-aed1-4d00-ab4b-cdd02510be91).
3. Determine what supplies you need for the event.&#x20;
4. If we need to order items, share the items and links with Finance by [posting in the Finance Channel](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/channel/19%3A59f8569e53644af0bc8e0df1b8d0c750%40thread.tacv2/Finance?groupId=13a3570e-1587-4b29-9596-18efe1cf3500\&tenantId=1113be34-aed1-4d00-ab4b-cdd02510be91)
   1. In order to buy items, Finance must request the P-Card 1.5 weeks before the purchase date. This means you'll likely need to make the request 2-3 weeks before the event.
5. Request graphics from Marketing & Design [by posting in the Marketing Channel](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/channel/19%3A4012b1eef8ec4ed5b2c0717e8e0a877c%40thread.tacv2/Marketing?groupId=13a3570e-1587-4b29-9596-18efe1cf3500\&tenantId=1113be34-aed1-4d00-ab4b-cdd02510be91).
   1. Include date, time, location, description of the event, and what visuals/aesthetic/vibe you want from the graphics. Do this at least 2 weeks in advance.
   2. Work with Marketing to determine when this event will appear on Instagram, Facebook, Bluesky, X (formerly Twitter), etc.
6. Request a BeInvolved update, website update, and ticketing link from Technical Production [by posting in the Production Channel](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/channel/19%3A2720a2c80e8e408284aac139f0a740d0%40thread.tacv2/Production?groupId=13a3570e-1587-4b29-9596-18efe1cf3500\&tenantId=1113be34-aed1-4d00-ab4b-cdd02510be91).&#x20;
   1. Include date, time, location, and a description of the event. Consider that Production will need Marketing's graphics for BeInvolved/the website.... and Marketing will need Production's ticketing link. Work in advance on this one, too.
   2. Work with Technical Production if you'd like an email blast to our emailing list
