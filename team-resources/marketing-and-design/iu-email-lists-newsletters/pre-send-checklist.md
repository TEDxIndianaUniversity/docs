#### Email content

We recommend you use a render test tool, such as Return Path, Email on Acid, or Litmus, to test and review your email content across many different devices.&#x20;

If you don’t have access to a render test tool, view your email preview tests on a smartphone, Outlook on Windows (version 2016 and any other versions you can access), Gmail, and any other email client you can test. We also recommend having multiple people review the email if possible.&#x20;
