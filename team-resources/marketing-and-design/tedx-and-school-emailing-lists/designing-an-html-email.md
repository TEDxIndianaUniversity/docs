## Overview

Designing an email works a lot like designing a poster... it should be visually appealing, contain all the content a person might need, and be brief enough to fit their attention span. When you're designing this email, feel free to hand sketch or use a design tool [like our Figma team](https://figma.com/), which you can join using one of our [Invite Links](https://kb.tedxiu.com/i/passwords/invite-links).
