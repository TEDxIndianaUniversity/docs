## What to Consider

Before, during, and after the conference, people will likely be utilising the venue's additional space! There are a number of things to consider:

### 1. Time

**Audience members will utilise the spaces differently at different times... what do they need or expect along every step of the way? What do we need to add/change/move/remove during the conference so the physical spaces are ready for when the audience needs them?**

* **Pre-Conference:** Mulling about, waiting for doors to open, don't know anything about the talks... maybe just know the theme
* **Mid-Conference Intermission:** Likely rushing to use the restrooms, getting a drink, or stretching their legs
* **Leaving Conference:** Either rushing straight out... or taking some time to talk with friends and family about what they just saw... maybe using the restroom again or buying that merch that caught their eye for the 3rd time... giving a donation because they loved conference?
* **Post-Conference:** What can we do to re-engage the audience hours, days, weeks after the conference? Ask for reviews and feedback? Raffle/give away? Social media? Emails/newsletters? Facebook chatting about ideas/talks? Donations?

### 2. Location

**Different parts of the spaces are better suited for certain experiences. Consider how we can engage people along each step of their experience.**

* **Outside the venue:**  Guiding lost audience members to the venue, luring in passersby, advertising the event to future patrons
* **Ticketing counter and coat room:** Audience members will likely want to check in at the box office and unload their coats and umbrellas right has they enter the venue
* **Lobby:** After ticketing, you have a chance to create experiences that they interact with... is it to sell them something? engage them with the theme? encourage them to sit down and have a chat with friends or strangers?
* **Restrooms:** This is when they take a pause... quiet in a loud venue... what can you provide them? How can something as simple as a restroom break become a subtle experience? Mirror decals for a photo-op, custom theme-related soaps, thought-provoking toilet stall messages, motivational signs on the tampon dispenser?

### **3. Physical Considerations**

**Now, consider the signs, booths, furniture, and technology that sit in these spaces**

* **Signage:** Show audience members where to go for ticketing, coat room, auditorium, booths/experiences, restrooms, etc.
* Tables to **sell goods**, achieve call-to-action, **collect data:** What do we need them from them before they leave? social follows? emailing list? purchases? donations?
* **Engagement Tables/Booths:** How can they engage with the theme? How can this conference be memorable?
* **Furniture:** Can audience members to sit on and have a chat? Discuss these ideas worth spreading?
* **TVs** or other technology: Do you want people outside the venue or on a mid-conference restroom break to be able to see/hear the talks?
* **Overall** **flow:** Can people easily move through the space?

### **4. Customer Experience (CX) or Audience Experience**

* **Comfort:** What do members need to do to make the audience feel at home? Welcomed? Feel like they have amazing service where they don't have to worry about anything?
* **Accessibility:** What are we doing for people with limited mobility? In wheelchairs? For people who are mute or partially mute? What about parents with small children? What about someone who (crap, not now!) is having their period?
