# ü•∞ Karen!!! & Luddy

## Karen&#x20;

* Karen is very nice and extremely hardworking... meet with her/president once per month!
* She basically never remembered me (once I saw her 3 times in 5 days and each time, she forgot me)
  * It‚Äôs incredibly important that she does know (and remembers) you though. If you have a good/trusting relationship with her, she‚Äôll be more likely to forgive you when something (inevitably) goes wrong, or you want something done last minute
  * Meet with her once before the semester ends
  * Next year, try to meet her at least once a month, even invite her to a coffee or something!
  * (Reece:) Karen is amazing! She's super chatty and just wants to get to know the students she's supporting. She's chill, easy going, and has lots of tea. Definitely drop by her office, even if you don't have anything you need! She loves when students check in to see how she's doing with no pretext.
* Karen is always very busy, do your best to give her 1.5-2 weeks in advance for whatever you need
  * This means your board will need to have everything sorted prior to this. Definitely inform of this constraint early in the year and keep bringing up how important it is that you get any requests early enough to give Karen time
* Side note: Tiana is someone I‚Äôve never interacted with, but is extremely crucial to this TEDx, Luddy, Karen dynamic
  * Tiana is Karen‚Äôs boss (and is a girl boss in general -Reece)
  * She is a great connection to have for all things Luddy/Funding/TEDx related
  * If for some reason you ever need money from Luddy, ask Karen to introduce you to Tiana
  * Tiana (and Karen) love TEDx because we increase the social aspect of Luddy, more than likely she‚Äôll be able to help in some way
* I spoke to Karen recently and she said she prefers to be contacted from your personal IU email so that she can match the name with the request
  * Try to cc the TED email on every email you send her so that there is more transparency for everyone

## Luddy

* Luddy is not the easiest to work with
* They consistently change their rules and make it difficult to get things done quickly (think a lot of red tape). This is both because the school is growing and bc IU keeps changing their policy
* Just really try to plan ahead and give yourself 2 weeks to accomplish any task with them
* Luddy Makerspace
  * If you/Technical Production ever get anything made here, you can bill directly to the TEDx account (because we‚Äôre in Luddy, Makerspace is in Luddy, you get it)
* Wells Library Plotter Printer
  * Only takes CrimsonCash
  * Will have to load P-card money onto someone‚Äôs card o Get Karen‚Äôs express permission before doing this, or just email her and have her do it
  * To do this, you just need the person‚Äôs Student ID and IU username o Note: there is a $2.50 processing fee you can‚Äôt get around
* Each semester Luddy asks for a budget
  * Since TEDx runs on a yearly system, I just put together a budget for the full year and sent it to them each semester (emphasizing that the budget was for the year)

## The TEDx Bank Account

* All of the money we receive goes to a general Luddy account
* Generally, whoever deposits the money is supposed to select the correct sub-account so that Karen knows it‚Äôs our money
  * Sometimes they forget to do this \*_cough RHA cough\*_
* Whenever you expect a deposit, let Karen know who to expect it from, why we‚Äôre receiving it, and the quantity to expect
* That way she can verify we receive it and move it into the correct sub-account if they misplace it
  * All of our account information can be found in [Teams ‚Üí Finance ‚Üí Files ‚Üí Funding ‚Üí ](https://indiana.sharepoint.com/:f:/r/sites/O365-TEDxI/Shared%20Documents/Finance/Funding?csf=1\&web=1\&e=uMfE8D)‚ÄúGeneral Useful Info‚Äù
