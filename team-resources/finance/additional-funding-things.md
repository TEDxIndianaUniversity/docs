# üßê Additional Funding Things

## Big TED&#x20;

* TED gives out grants/funding too I think
* I didn‚Äôt look into this at all this year, but Amanda was saying something about it

## Metz Grant

* An opportunity that comes every 2 years
* We received this 2 years ago when Lucy was Director
* It wasn‚Äôt available for me to apply for in time for conference this year
* Maybe something you can investigate in the fall
* I‚Äôll leave all the documents we used in the past for this for you in Teams

## FYE (First Year Experience)

* I think they discontinued this because I could find nothing on it
* They used to give us $500, but I suspect they were usurped by RHA
* Something you could investigate as well

## General Grants/Funding

* Suki (past president) was interested in this line of thinking
* She wanted to diversify funding sources, in case IU can't give out as much some years
* Essentially, there are probably general grants/scholarships/etc. out there that we could apply to
* The only thing I would caution is that Luddy and IU and TED have guidelines about how we can receive money
  * I would learn more about what is allowed/not allowed before spending energy on this
