# 👋 Team Considerations

### Recruiting

* As I'm sure you know, historically the finance team has been 1 Director + 2-3 Members
* When Lucy was director, there were 2 members. When Aashna was director, there were 3 members. When I was director, there were 2 members.
* In my opinion, 3 is too many. I think 1 is best, but depending on your vision for the role, 2 could work. Any more than that is beyond my ability to imagine – however, if you have a vision that requires 3 people, I say jump on that!

### Team Meetings

* I only held a group team meeting once
  * I did meet with Ananya and Saniya more individually so it’s not like we never spoke though
  * For some important meetings I had, I left brief meeting notes. They can be found in Teams → Finance → Files → Team Meetings
    * I’m not sure these will be helpful at all, but in case you want them!
* I quickly realized that there isn't very much group work to do, and I didn’t want to waste anyone’s time by having them meet together
* In hindsight, it only isolated my already isolated members, but I can’t really change that now
* I think the change to have Ops and Finance meet together will really bring the finance members into the greater TED community
* I think this will also help Ops a lot because they’ll realize how far in advance they need to have expenses planned
* This will ideally lighten your workload, motivate early planning, and ensure a good relationship with Karen
* If you can, test this idea. Hopefully it will work, if not, I’m sure you’ll find another solution

### Work Distribution

* I had Ananya work on the funding pitches and write the RHA application
  * RHA is all about connecting to freshman and those living in dorms
  * Seeing as I haven’t lived in a dorm in 2 years + I hated living in the dorm freshman year, I figured Ananya would be best at writing this
  * The answers I submitted are in Teams → Finance → Files → Funding → RHA → FINAL – Play or Pause → “RHA - Submitted Responses”
  * There was an excel file I had to attach to that application as well, it’s the only spreadsheet in that same “FINAL - Play or Pause” folder
  * I also wanted to take her to funding pitches so that if she did become director, she’d be well-equipped in the future
  * Not to mention, she’s a Kelley kid, so this is really just good practice
* I had Saniya work on finding local businesses to contact
  * She put together a spreadsheet of local businesses that I’ve left for you in Teams → Finance → Files → Business Outreach → “List of Businesses”
  * She also wrote a document explaining what we would provide the businesses and what we were asking for in return. That doc is in the same folder as the above spreadsheet but named “Business-Outreach”
    * I had Production design/format this, so it’s beautiful, but it is Play or Pause themed
    * Unless you want to change our tiering system, I think the body of the message can stay, but you’ll have to make a design change + change the # of speakers, date of conference, etc. I have left Saniya’s original word document in the same folder but named “Bloomington Business Partnership with TEDxIU”
    * I sent all the partnership emails through the TED email but then cc’ed myself and Saniya to all of them. I had Saniya draft the email to send to the local businesses. This is in the same folder but named “Email to Businesses”
* Saniya and I also brainstormed the gift baskets together
  * I’m not actually sure whose job this is supposed to be
  * I say, figure this out before you decide to take it on for sure
  * Saniya did it for Curation 2 years ago, so her expertise was incredibly helpful (let’s be real, she did all the heavy lifting here)
  * In the end, she helped me design all aspects of the gift bag, she assembled them, and I wrote all the cards (from the club and from the executive board)
    * Note: I had all the curators write a card to their speaker separately
  * Gift Basket Contents this Year: Engraved acrylic plaque, handwritten card from exec, handwritten card from curator, handwritten card on behalf of full club (I wanted everyone to sign this one, but it didn’t work out), B-town Box gift box, IU/Bloomington mug, TEDx Keychain
    * I wanted to do something more conference themed like a conference tote bag or conference mug, but we ended up running out of time hence the generic mug
* I worked on the IUFB application (as I’m the only one who has access to it) and submitted all the other funding applications through the TED email
  * The full IUFB applications (both for the conference and Amanda’s TEDxWomen Conference) are in Teams → Finance → Files → Funding → IUFB → Ending in “Funding Request”
  * Note: you will also be able to see this in BeInvolved (where I submitted them). In fact, you can see every application ever submitted to IUFB there in case you want to reference them.
  * The HHC application I submitted is in Teams → Finance → Files → Funding → Hutton Honors → FINAL – Play or Pause Teams → Starting with “TEDxIndianaUniversity”
    * Note: I know the file name is ridiculously long, but it’s their requested naming convention
    * I also documented the email chain between me and them in case that’s helpful for you “HHC Funding Email Chain”
* I also handled anything that had to do with the P-Card or interacting with Karen
