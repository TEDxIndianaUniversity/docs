# üí≥ Purchasing

## P-Card

* The Luddy debit card!
* With great power comes great responsibility
  * Karen hates it when people she doesn‚Äôt know comes to get the p-card
  * This is another reason why I said to become friends with her
* Remember, we are tax-exempt; it is such a nightmare to undo it when people pay taxes using the P-card
  * Sometimes you have to harass people into taking the tax-exempt code, but it is necessary that you do this Requesting the Card
* Luddy is changed up how to get the p-card this year
  * This system sucks and is inefficient, so I don‚Äôt know if they‚Äôll keep it next year, but I‚Äôll document it for you all the same
    * Start by filling out the excel sheet which can be found in [Teams ‚Üí Finance ‚Üí Files ‚Üí Purchase Requests ](https://indiana.sharepoint.com/:f:/r/sites/O365-TEDxI/Shared%20Documents/Finance/Purchase%20Requests?csf=1\&web=1\&e=hexfXX)‚Üí ‚ÄúBill of Materials Template‚Äù
      * I suggest just duplicating this file every time you want to use it
  * Fill out whatever information it wants (I have plenty of examples in this same folder for you to reference)
  * Fill out the qualtrics form that is linked to the original, blank, template file
  * You‚Äôre done! If you don‚Äôt hear back from Karen in 1.5 weeks, then you can email to follow up with her. However, we were told to wait that long first.
* I‚Äôm sure you can see how this is not efficient or speedy, so like all other things TED-finance related, plan ahead!
  * Note: In the past, you would just email Karen when you wanted it and she‚Äôd tell you whether or not you could have it&#x20;
  * This approach still works, but only reserve it for emergency type things because this is not preferred

## Amazon Purchases

* It‚Äôs natural to think that you can purchase things from Amazon using the p-card
* This is partially true and partially not true
  * If you need to buy something from Amazon, I suggest putting together a large list and making the purchase all at once
  * Follow the steps to request the p-card as you normally would (excel spreadsheet + form), but provide the link to every project in the spreadsheet
  * Then when you go to submit the form, in the comments section AND ‚Äúwhen you‚Äôll come to get the p-card" section, state something like ‚ÄúPlease order these items from Amazon‚Äù
* Like any other time you request the p-card, submit all this information well in advance Informal (but good) Rules
* In my personal opinion, the only person who should ever pick up the p-card are you (Director of Finance), Director of Operations, and President
  * That's what we did this year and it worked brilliantly
  * Inevitably the Director of Operations will spend a lot of time with Karen, so it‚Äôs important Karen knows them as well
  * Purva was Director of Operations 2 years ago so she should already have a good relationship with Karen, and Amanda, Reece, and Karen already knew each other from other Luddy stuff
* Do NOT ever hand the p-card to anybody that is not Exec or the operations team
  * It is IMPERATIVE, that receipts are kept, and the money is handled well
  * The 1, singular time, I let someone not the people mentioned above have the card, they did not save the receipt (even though I explicitly said it multiple times and wrote it on instructions for them) and I got in trouble for it
