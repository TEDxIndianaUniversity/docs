# 🎭 BCT (Buskirk-Chumley Theatre)

* Our contract with the BCT was estimated to be almost $7,000
  * I think in the end we paid them almost $5,000
* How this works, they have a list of things they provide/do
  * Each of these list items has an associated cost
  * The estimates are estimated (obviously), and differ ever so slightly from the actual costs
* There are things that are standard and included in every contract (think base charges like just renting the theater, staff, etc.)
* There are additional things that are “add-ons” and cost more
  * This is like the stage extension, how many mics we want, etc.
  * I’ll be so honest, I let Reece pick out whatever he wanted and told him that we’ll cover all the costs
* I have no doubt that the invoice breaks all this down, but I never looked at it in detail
  * Reece was like “don’t worry, I won't let them charge us for random things we don’t need” and I trust that he did this, but I have no idea what he actually ended up doing vs what was offered by the BCT
* We had free student tickets this year, the BCT was okay with this, we just had to let them know in advance
  * In the past student tickets have been fairly expensive
  * If you guys decide to do paid student tickets again, choose something between $1-$15 I think
  * Here's my thoughts on this: I think student tickets being free is cool and there’s an added bonus that IUFB gives us more money. However, people who are on the fence about coming are more likely not to come because they didn’t spend anything on it
  * I don’t think either route is right/wrong, it’s just something to have a conversation with the board about
  * Note: they originally had a $4 processing fee. We asked them to remove this so it would be completely free
* For all paid tickets
  * I didn’t actually experience this this year, but Lucy told me when we had paid student tickets, we gave out a good percentage of them for free via student clubs and campus organizations
  * In reality, these tickets weren’t free, TEDx (aka Karen) purchased them from the BCT in “bulk” and then redistributed them.&#x20;
  * Essentially, we lost money on these “free” tickets
  * Whenever we make money from ticket sales, they adjust our invoice amount before sending it to us
  * Ex: all costs included we get charged $6,000 but we had $2,000 in ticket sales, the bill we get is $4,000
