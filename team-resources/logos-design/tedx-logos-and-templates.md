# ❌ TEDx Logos & Templates

{% hint style="danger" %}
Failure to follow these guideline may cause us to lose our license. Please use our TEDxIndianaUniversity logo and the non-related TED and TEDx logos cautiously.
{% endhint %}

## Download and Use our Logos

TEDxIndianaUniversity Members can access our official logos in [**Microsoft Teams > Marketing Channel > Files > Logos & Design Standards**](https://indiana.sharepoint.com/:f:/r/sites/O365-TEDxI/Shared%20Documents/Marketing/Logos%20%26%20Design%20Standards?csf=1\&web=1\&e=Lw5SPr).

## TEDx Logo

**Teams are no longer required to include the tagline "x=independently organized TED event" in event logos.** You’ll use your TEDx logo throughout every part of your event: on your website(s), social media, and all event communications, materials and signs. The TEDx logo is different from the TED logo, as it contains the “x” at the end as well as the unique location-based name of your event.\


### **Rules to Remember**

* **Never use the TED or TEDx logos!** Only **TEDxIndianaUniversity** may be used.\
  \

  ![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (5).png>)\


Your TEDx logo must appear on your website, all outbound communications with speakers, attendees and sponsors, and all PR and marketing materials.

* The updated logo guidelines are mandatory for new series first licensed on or after January 1, 2023. However, TEDx organizers with event series first licensed before 2023 have the option to maintain their previous logo or use the updated guidelines.

### Font, Colour, and Visual Spec

{% hint style="info" %}
Download the Inter font family from the [_**Google Fonts webpage**_](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Inter?query=inter).
{% endhint %}

* **Font:** The typeface Helvetica is an integral part of our visual identity, and it comes pre-installed on most computers. If you do not have access to Helvetica, you can use Inter Light, which is a nearly identical open-source font.\
  If you have a different version of Helvetica (Helvetica Neue, for example), use the Regular weight of your version.
* **Tracking:** Letter-spacing in the TEDx logo templates is set to 0. Do not adjust this setting.
* **Kerning:** You can kern individual letters in your location name, if needed.
* **Alignment:** The name of your event should always align left in relation to the "TEDx" part of the logo, and should be sized to be exactly the same height as the "TEDx" part of the logo. Tracking in the TEDx logo templates is set to 0. Do not adjust this setting.
* **Color:** your TEDx event's logo should always include a red "TEDx" and either black or white text for the other words.\
  **TED Red is HEX Color #EB0028.**

## Background and Spacing

### Background color <a href="#h3--background-color" id="h3--background-color"></a>

Only use a solid white or black background.\


![Example logos: Background color](https://pi.tedcdn.com/r/pb-assets.tedcdn.com/system/baubles/files/000/009/912/original/bw_backgrounds.png?u%5Br%5D=2\&u%5Bs%5D=0.5\&u%5Ba%5D=0.8\&u%5Bt%5D=0.03\&quality=82\&w=1400)

### Clear space <a href="#h3--clear-space" id="h3--clear-space"></a>

To ensure that your TEDx event logo is presented in the best possible manner, a minimum buffer zone of clear space should always be maintained around its perimeter. Keep other logos, graphics or copy out of this zone. (Logos may not be "locked up" with any other logos or images. Other logos cannot appear as if they are a part of your TEDx event logo.)\

## No-Nos

Do not set the place name in all caps and keep it the same size as "TEDx."

![Example of incorrect logo: name in all caps](https://pi.tedcdn.com/r/pb-assets.tedcdn.com/system/baubles/files/000/009/906/original/dontdo_caps.jpg?u%5Br%5D=2\&u%5Bs%5D=0.5\&u%5Ba%5D=0.8\&u%5Bt%5D=0.03\&quality=82\&w=1400)



Do not change the color of TEDx or the “x” in TEDx. Do not write the place name in colors other than black or white.

Do not place your TEDx event's logo on colors other than black or white or on photographic, patterned or illustrated backgrounds.

Only use 2 or more lines when necessary.

Do not create your TEDx event's logo in a typeface other than Helvetica or Inter Light.
