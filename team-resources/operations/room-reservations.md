## Reserving a Room

* If it's a **classroom on campus**, you'll likely need to request it via BeInvolved. Check the [Student Life website here](https://studentlife.indiana.edu/involvement-belonging/student-involvement-leadership/plan-event/index.html) for the latest directions.
  * This can require _**a few weeks**_ in order to ensure the room is booked. Book sooner rather than later!
* Some rooms are controlled by the school/building they're in. Some schools prefer that a major/minor of that school put in the request... find someone in TEDx if that's the case!
