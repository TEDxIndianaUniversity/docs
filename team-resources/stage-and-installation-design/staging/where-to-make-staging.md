## IU Theatre Department

_They may or may not let you use the space, depending on their current productions_

The Theatre Department has several spaces, including the [**Scenic Studio**](https://theatre.indiana.edu/research-creative-activity/facilities-resources/production-spaces/scenic-studio.html). Supervisor of the Scenic Studio is [**Sean Dumm**](https://theatre.indiana.edu/about/faculty/dumm-sean.html)**.**

If they won't let you use the space, nearly all their productions just discard their staging. You can contact the Scenic Supervisor or specific production leadership to ask about inheriting scenic items you've seen on stage. Often times, they will just give things to you if you ask.
