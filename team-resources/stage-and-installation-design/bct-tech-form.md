## Things to Know

### Tables

They have lots of tables... use them! Note: their table cloths are "maroon" which are literally just brownish. If you want "red" TEDx will need to procure some on our own.

### Merch

You may consider selling merch at the BCT. Consider two things. (1) Don't pay for a BCT staff member to sell the merch. Put 2-3 TEDx members on it. (2) TEDx is an official unit of IU and cannot use venmo/cash app/paypal to process payments. You must use an IU approved method.

### Parking

Be sure to reserve parking! It's right behind the BCT and will be needed to load in staging stuff.

### Stage

Generally, we go for a 6ft. extension on the stage. Work with the BCT _in advance_ if you want to fly (i.e. hang) anything from the stage. "Soft goods" (curtains, drapes, etc.) under 100lbs generally don't need to be counter-balanced and aren't a big deal. Heavier objects deserve a meeting with the venue technical director to see if they're feasible/safe/need stage-hand labour.

### Audio

Generally, we rent 2 handheld mics and 4 lapel mics. In the past, BCT staff have been sound engineer (i.e. they operate the sound board). If a live performance is occuring (e.g. intermission or one of the speakers), consider if there's instruments or vocalists that will need mics, monitors/speakers, music stands, etc. Get those folks in the conversation early so they can work with the venue on what they need.&#x20;

### A/V and Slides

Always use laptop audio and laptop out for slides. Be sure to have more laptops than necessary and pre-plan/rehearse how people will work things. Generally, we use PowerPoint for slides.&#x20;

### Lighting

Since we release video recordings of our TEDx Talks, we use a three-point lighting scheme. Additionally, it would be nice if the TEDx sign was illuminated with low intensity by an additional front light (not just top light).

### Videography

The cameras at the BCT are eh. But they're way cheaper than other models

\[Reece needs to show price comparison here]
