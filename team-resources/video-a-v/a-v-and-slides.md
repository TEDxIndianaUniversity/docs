# ðŸ“ˆ A/V and Slides

## Slides

* Speaker slide guidelines and template are on the [Speaker Knowledge Base](https://app.gitbook.com/s/tCiaJkmdXjI1rcT80tcF/slides-and-a-v). You can edit those guidelines just like you would this Knowledge Base.
* **Use PowerPoint or Keynote ONLY.** DO NOT allow Google Slides, Canva, or Prezi. Again: don't allow _any other_ slide formats. It's not worth it and doesn't work well. We are presenting professional slides.
* **Use a Mac.** Don't use a PC. It's not worth it. You're likely to run into driver issues, and PC doesn't have support for essential applications such as [QLab](https://qlab.app/), Keynote, and other theatre software.
* **Hide annoying and unprofessional UI:** Before the event/rehearsal starts, be sure to disable navigational UI elements that appear in the bottom left of slides on PowerPoint. On macOS: open PowerPoint > Command + Comma > Presenting Slides > Slide Navigation > No Controls / Off
* **Double check fonts.** Generally, you should always [set PowerPoint to package fonts ](https://www.howtogeek.com/660274/how-to-embed-fonts-in-powerpoint/)with your slide deck (now, that's something Google Slides can't do!). However, some will forget to do this. Double check all the fonts in a deck before rehearsals.
* **No Desktop Backgrounds.** Set your desktop background **to solid black**, so the audience won't know if an application crashes or closes and forces you back to your desktop.&#x20;
* **Extend your display.** This is a TEDx conference, not a class presentation. Never (even in class) duplicate your display.
* **Know how to duplicate external displays.** Before the day of, play around with how to make two external monitors show the same thing out of a computer. This gets you more HDMI outs than you would normally and prevents the need for 27 HDMI splitters (you'll probably still need some.... but less than before).
* \[Reece needs to write about how to duplicate extended displays and what's supported on which Mac]



## A/V at the Venue

* **Map out your computer use before the event:** Be sure to arrive with all the computers, cables, external monitors, and dongles you'll need
* **Where is the screen?** If at the BCT, putting the screen centre stage can utilise the "small projector". If you want to float the screen off stage left (for example), you will need to use the "large projector" and use [projection-mappping.md](../theatrical/projection-mappping.md "mention") to adjust the projection to where the screen is on stage. Anticipate you'll need an extra laptop, HDMI capture, HDMI cables, etc. for this.
* **Click click:** Be sure you're using a click with _more than enough_ range. Even the "it normally works" Logitech clicker from the BCT, we've run into range issues before. Also be sure to **remind them to charge their clicker** (sigh from experience). If you're at another venue, bring backup AA, AAA, and 9V batteries just in case.
* \[Reece should add A/V drafts and setups... maybe in Mermade... maybe in Drafty]
