**Subject:** Potential Opportunity to Speak at TEDxIndianaUniversity (_feel free to modify subject line, just run it through me first!)_

Dear \_\_\_\_\_,&#x20;

My name is \_\_\_\_\_ -- I am a head curator at TEDxIndianaUniversity. I am reaching out to you regarding an opportunity to give a TEDx Talk. Each year, we bring together 50,000 students and the greater Bloomington community through ideas worth spreading. On \[Date], we will host six speakers and 700 attendees at the historic Buskirk Chumley theater for a night of exploration and learning. This year, our theme is \[Theme].&#x20;

&#x20;

With your experience in \_\_\_\_\_\_ and unique perspective \_\_\_\_\_\_ we feel you could be a wonderful addition to the lineup. As a TEDx organization we are unable to offer payment but do cover all travel, lodging, and dining expenses. &#x20;

&#x20;

We would like to arrange a time to get to know you more and speak regarding potential fit. We can take this time to answer any questions you may have as well. We look forward to hearing from you!&#x20;

&#x20;

Best,&#x20;

\[Your Name]&#x20;
