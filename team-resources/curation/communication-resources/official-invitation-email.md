# Official Invitation Email

**Subject Line:** TEDxIndianaUniversity Speaking Invitation for \[Name] &#x20;

\[Speaker], &#x20;

I am thrilled to formally invite you to give a TEDx Talk at TEDxIndianaUniversity's 2024-2025 Conference, Tipping Point! Everyone here at TEDxIU is ecstatic about the prospect of you joining us, and we cannot wait to welcome you to Bloomington. &#x20;

If you would like to accept, the first step in crafting your talk is signing the Speaker Content Development Agreement attached to this email. Please send a signed copy back to me before (Date). Within the next few weeks, you will also be receiving a Speaker Information Packet, which will include details about TEDxIU, the theme, the speaker reimbursement process, and a tentative timeline for the conference. &#x20;

Lastly, I would love to connect on either a video or phone call to start planning your talk. I’m available on \[Availability]. If those times don’t work, I'm happy to find a mutually convenient time. &#x20;

Looking forward to hearing from you! &#x20;

Best, &#x20;
