# Official Invitation Email

**Subject Line:** TEDxIndianaUniversity Speaking Invitation for \[Name] &#x20;



\[Speaker], &#x20;

I am very excited to formally invite you to give a TEDx Talk at TEDxIndianaUniversity's 2024-2025 Conference, \[Theme]! Everyone here at TEDxIU is ecstatic about the prospect of you joining the conference and we cannot wait to host you in Bloomington.&#x20;



Should you wish to accept, the first step in crafting your talk is signing the Speaker Content Development Agreement attached to this email. I ask that you send a signed copy of the agreement to me before (Date). Within the next few weeks you will also be receiving a Speaker Information Packet that will provide you information about TEDxIU, the theme, the speaker reimbursement process, and a tentative conference timeline. &#x20;

Lastly, I would love the chance to connect on either a video / phone call to start planning your talk. \[Availability]. If none of those times work, I'm sure we can find mutually agreeable times soon. &#x20;

Looking forward to hearing from you!&#x20;

Best,&#x20;
