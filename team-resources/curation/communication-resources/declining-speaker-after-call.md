After careful consideration, we’ve decided not to move forward with an invitation to speak at this year’s conference. That said, I genuinely appreciate the opportunity to learn more about your journey. &#x20;

Thank you again for your time, and I wish you all the best for your upcoming projects!&#x20;

Best, &#x20;
