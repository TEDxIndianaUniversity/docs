# ðŸ“¬ The Outreach Process

As part of Phase 2, you will be reaching out a minimum of 15 speakers\* each week. This will take place from mid-October to mid-November.&#x20;

<mark style="background-color:yellow;">**What it will look like:**</mark>

1. Research potential speakers. Check what's happening in our community, explore what's interesting to you, look for ideas worth spreading.
2. Every time you find a speaker, send them an email/LinkedIn message/any other professional medium with [this email template.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1IJvOWfn3vwh5xCA617b83frXYfcrC6OkoNHwX8uWwvc/edit#heading=h.krdwz6nvdmmv)  (remember, you don't have to think they'd be perfect to give a TEDx Talk -- you are simply exploring and getting to know them before you actually select a speaker).&#x20;
3. Update your [speaker tracker](https://indiana.sharepoint.com/:x:/r/sites/O365-TEDxI/Shared%20Documents/Curation/Resources/Trackers/Outreach%20Tracker.xlsx?d=w47fdeaf1e03b49589d60ceb35281ebbe\&csf=1\&web=1\&e=9sw1Bk) with their information.&#x20;
4. Did you hear back? CC me with their response. If they declined invitation, send them a thank you note using [this template.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1IJvOWfn3vwh5xCA617b83frXYfcrC6OkoNHwX8uWwvc/edit#heading=h.zegwrgp6dhk6)
5. Schedule a call with them using [this template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1IJvOWfn3vwh5xCA617b83frXYfcrC6OkoNHwX8uWwvc/edit#heading=h.5s42vz5sjeyl) and get to know them. Ask them about their life experiences, stories, and what they would want to give a potential talk about.

{% hint style="info" %}
To guide your call, you can ask these questions:

* What's a controversy in your field that a general audience would understand?
* What's a common misconception you'd love to clear up?
* Why is this idea important, and to whom?
* Who would disagree with you, and why?
* How did you carry out this idea in your own work?
* What's the big idea behind your new project? How did you sell that idea to funders and collaborators?
{% endhint %}

5. Write down notes for all calls and deposit them in this [Teams folder here](https://indiana.sharepoint.com/:f:/r/sites/O365-TEDxI/Shared%20Documents/Curation/Outreach/Call%20Notes?csf=1\&web=1\&e=lJLQgB). Bullet point notes are fine!
6. Update speaker tracker with post-call remarks. Did anything stand out?
7. Repeat for 15 speakers/week.
