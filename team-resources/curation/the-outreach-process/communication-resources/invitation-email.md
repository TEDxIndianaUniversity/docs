Subject: Potential Opportunity to Speak at TEDxIndianaUniversity (feel free to modify subject line, just run it through me first!)&#x20;

Dear \_\_\_\_\_, &#x20;

My name is \_\_\_\_\_ -- I am a curator at TEDxIndianaUniversity. I am reaching out to explore an exciting opportunity for you to give a TEDx Talk. Each year, TEDxIndianaUniversity brings together over 50,000 students and members of the Bloomington community to share ideas worth spreading.&#x20;

On February 21st, 2025, we will host six speakers and 700 attendees at the historic Buskirk Chumley theater for a night of exploration and learning. This year, our theme is Tipping Point. &#x20;

With your experience in \_\_\_\_\_\_ and unique perspective \_\_\_\_\_\_ we believe you would be a wonderful addition to the lineup. As a TEDx organization we cover all travel, lodging, and dining expenses to ensure you have a great experience at Indiana University. &#x20;

We would like to arrange a time to get to know you more and speak regarding potential fit. We can take this time to answer any questions you may have as well. We look forward to hearing from you! &#x20;

Best, &#x20;
