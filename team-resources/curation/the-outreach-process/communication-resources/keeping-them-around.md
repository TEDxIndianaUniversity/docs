# Keeping-them-around

**Subject:** Follow-Up on TEDxIndianaUniversity Speaker Opportunity

Dear \[Speaker's Name],

Thank you again for taking the time to speak with me! I really enjoyed learning about your experiences and ideas regarding \[what they talked about]. As we’re in the process of meeting with a number of potential speakers, we’re still exploring who might be the best fit for this year’s conference.

We will continue to assess how the different talks could come together for the overall theme, and I will definitely keep your ideas in mind as we move forward. I’ll be in touch with more details as our planning progresses over the coming weeks.

In the meantime, if you have any further thoughts or questions, don’t hesitate to reach out. Thank you again for sharing your time and story with us!

Best,&#x20;
