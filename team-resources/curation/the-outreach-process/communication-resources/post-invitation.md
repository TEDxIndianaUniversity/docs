#### Subject: TEDxIndianaUniversity Follow-Up - Scheduling First Call

Thank you for considering our invitation to speak at TEDxIndianaUniversity! We are excited about the opportunity to explore how your insights can align with our event and audience.

To move forward, we’d love to schedule a brief 15–30 minute call to get to know you and discuss your potential fit with TEDxIndianaUniversity. Our theme for this year is "Tipping Point", and we would appreciate it if you could share a few interpretations of this theme that resonate with you. This will help guide our conversation.

During the call, we’ll cover:

* The TEDxIndianaUniversity theme and your interpretation
* A few guiding questions to understand your background and ideas
* Any questions you may have about the event

Our goal for this call is to gain a better understanding of the kind of ideas you can bring to the conference and to determine whether you would be a good speaker fit for TEDxIndianaUniversity. To help you prepare for our conversation, here are a few points to consider:

* We aim to bring forward ideas that are relatable, applicable, or of special interest to the Bloomington community.
* We’re looking for talks that present new ideas or challenge preconceived ones, leaving the audience with something thought-provoking to take away.
* We’re not seeking personal motivational stories, but rather a focus on your ideas, research, or work that could inspire new ways of thinking.

Here are a few sample TED/TEDx talks to help you get a sense of what we’re aiming for:

* [Why people believe they can’t draw - and how to prove they can | Graham Shaw | TEDxHull](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TXEZ4tP06c\&pp=ygUVeW91IGNhbiBkcmF3IHRlZCB0YWxr)
* [Inside the Mind of a Master Procrastinator | Tim Urban | TED](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arj7oStGLkU\&list=RDQM\_XxwKv1dVQQ\&index=4)
* [How language shapes the way we think | Lera Boroditsky | TED](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKK7wGAYP6k)

Would you be available for a call on \[suggest two or three dates/times]? If these don’t work, feel free to suggest alternatives.

We look forward to speaking with you and hearing your thoughts!
