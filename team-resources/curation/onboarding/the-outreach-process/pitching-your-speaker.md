# Pitching Your Speaker

Awesome! I (and the rest of exec) are super excited to hear about your speaker. Before we can finalize on your speaker, you will have to fill out [this speaker pitch document. ](https://indiana.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/sites/O365-TEDxI/Shared%20Documents/Curation/Outreach/Pitch.docx?d=w50dd1b0fcc194a3fba5efcbe575d1ee9\&csf=1\&web=1\&e=cHqXua)Please keep it under 2 pages and be as elaborate and comprehensive as you can -- thoughts, assumptions, helpful links/videos/documents, reservations.

## Exec Approved:&#x20;

Congratulations, we are so excited for you to get started with talk development. Before that, send them an official invitation email using [this template.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1IJvOWfn3vwh5xCA617b83frXYfcrC6OkoNHwX8uWwvc/edit#heading=h.9rnyqpjtrh1m)

## Exec Denied:&#x20;

Don't worry. We have a buffer period so that you can either look for another speaker or for you to get to know another amazing speaker that your curator friends have found. Continue the outreach process until you find your speaker and once you've found them, pitch them to us again!\
