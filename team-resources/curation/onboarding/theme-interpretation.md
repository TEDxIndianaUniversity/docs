<mark style="color:red;">Getting Started:</mark>&#x20;

* Think about the theme for a while&#x20;
* Write down anything that comes into your head, which can be words, sentences, stories, anything!&#x20;
* If you’re struggling, look up the word – articles, images, videos, news?&#x20;
* What emotion, visuals, words, messages, stories, is the theme screaming to you? &#x20;

<mark style="color:red;">Writing a Theme Interpretation:</mark> Open any word processor and write away! There is no format, please feel free to write away literally anything, explaining how you interpret this year’s theme and why you interpret it in such a way, with visuals to support your interpretation  (Anywhere from 400-800 words)

_**Send your complete theme interpretations to samthant@iu.edu the night before Onboarding #2  and be prepared to discuss your interpretations with the team!**_
