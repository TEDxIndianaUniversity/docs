# ðŸ¤” Understanding TEDx

Preparing to be a TEDx curator can be tough. It's not just good networking skills, time commitment, and great organizational skills that go into it. At the core, you have to really understand what makes a good TED talk, a good TED talk.&#x20;

Anyone can give a talk, but not anyone can give a _**great**_**&#x20;TED talk.**&#x20;

Before we start the process of outreach, we need to make sure you understand what makes a TED talk different. To do this, you'll have to:

*   [x] Read _TED Talks: The Official Guide to Public Speaking_ in its entirety (we will provide you with physical copies, YAY!)&#x20;

    > Critical chapters: 1-9. Since onboarding will happen within 1.5 weeks and I recognize that this might not be enough time to digest the entire book, we will be having milestones in our biweekly meetings where we summarize a certain number of chapters together with the rest of the team!
* [x] Read TEDx curation guidelines [here](https://www.ted.com/participate/organize-a-local-tedx-event/tedx-organizer-guide/speakers-program)&#x20;
  * [x] Watch one sample TED talk for each type of talk (big idea, tech demo, etc..)
* [x] Watch these technical videos:
  * [TEDx Spectators to Participants](https://youtu.be/_bQTqh4Hp-o)
  * [Chris Anderson and Jay Herratti discuss the TED2018 curation process](https://youtu.be/Dh9jrj3NPz8)
  * [Will Davis: The Experiment continues](https://youtu.be/iVQ9ZmoKPbg)
  * [ How TED and TEDx communities are built: Kelly Stoetzel at TEDGlobal 2013](https://youtu.be/-oOoJk8Gt7k)

If you did all these, I trust that you understand what a TED talk is and that you'll be able to guide your selected speaker to give an amazing TED talk! (No pressure though :laughing:)
