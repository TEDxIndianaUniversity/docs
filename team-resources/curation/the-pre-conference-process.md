  WOO-HOO! We're now at our most important phase in the entire curation process,
  where you work with your speaker one-on-one to develop their talk!

# üìù The Pre-Conference Process

## Items Needed Throughout This Phase

* [ ] 2 drafts of their talk
* [ ] 1 final draft of their talk
* [ ] 1 recorded talk
* [ ] Visuals

## Timeline

Once you have confirmed the speaker and gotten Exec approval, start meeting with them biweekly and get started on Draft 1 early on! With the curation knowledge from the TEDx book, walk with your speaker to develop their final throughline and outline the talk together. For draft 1, take a more hands-off approach after developing the throughline and outline. See what the speaker comes up with! (Provided they have referred and read through the Speaker Guide (link TBD).

<mark style="color:red;">**January 6:**</mark> (need to confirm with Ops. Ignore this point for now) Your speaker will get confirmations regarding their flights and hotel bookings. This will be communicated to the speaker via the TEDxIU email -- meaning, you don't have to worry about this bit. If they ask, at any point in time after speaker selection regarding these logistics, tell them they will know by Jan 6.&#x20;

<mark style="color:red;">**January 6:**</mark> Email your speaker with this visual guide (link TBD); this is to help them prepare the slide deck that gets presented on-screen while they give their talk during the conference.&#x20;

<mark style="color:red;">**January 11:**</mark> First draft due!

_Between these two dates, it is **crucial** that you're meeting with your speaker biweekly (weekly if possible) to polish their draft. Exec will read and return with thoughts, feedbacks, and reservations after this first draft to you on **January 14.** In your call with your speaker, relay Exec's thoughts and feedback politely._

<mark style="color:red;">**January 22:**</mark> Second draft, recorded talk, and visual due!

<mark style="color:red;">**January 31:**</mark> (need to confirm with TP+D. Ignore this point for now) Technical production will provide revised, edited visuals. Send this to your speaker and ask them if they want to make any revisions/additions/edits.&#x20;

<mark style="color:red;">**January 31:**</mark> Final draft due!

<mark style="color:red;">**February 7:**</mark> Speaker sends us their revised visuals. No change to visuals from speaker possible beyond this point. Director of Curation emails speakers a pre-conference brief packet.

<mark style="color:red;">**February 14:**</mark> Director of Curation joins in on your calls with your speaker so we can have one final round of review.

<mark style="color:red;">**February 21:**</mark> Conference day!
