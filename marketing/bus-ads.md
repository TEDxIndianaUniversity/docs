# ðŸšŒ Bus Ads

We all know how important public transport is in Bloomington! Both IU buses and Bloomington Transit busses allow for marketing outside and inside the bus... for a relatively reasonable price.

## IU Bus

One can advertise using indoor card ads ("Rail Signs") for 2 months on _all bus routes(!)_ for a relatively reasonable price. Additionally, for outdoor ads, Curb-side Queen, Street-side Queen, Street-side King, and Full Wrap are available.
