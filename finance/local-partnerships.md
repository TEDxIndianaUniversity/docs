# 💜 Local Partnerships

* We made an effort this year to reach out to local businesses
* Because of our incredibly pressed timeline, this wasn’t sent out early enough.
  * I think we gave them 1.5 weeks to say yes/no, and the conference was 3 weeks after that
  * Definitely give yourself 6-8 weeks in advance! (think late December/early January)
* See the “Work Distribution” section in the “Team Considerations” page for further information
