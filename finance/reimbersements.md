# 💱 Reimbersements

## Member/Club Reimbursements

* I had a strict no member reimbursement policy this year
* They’re a logistical nightmare for all parties and take anywhere from 4-6 weeks to complete
* Karen hates doing them and the members never have all the information necessary to get a reimbursement
* Karen was extremely happy that there were limited reimbursements to handle this year, and I suggest you stick to this rule

## Executive Board Reimbursements

* The ONLY exception to this rule was exec board reimbursements
* I was extremely clear that if they did not keep their receipt, have the right documentation, etc. they would not receive a reimbursement
* I only did 2/3 of these reimbursements this year
* They occurred due to poor planning or the p-card acting weird

## Speaker Reimbursements

* Speaker reimbursements take anywhere from 4-6 (sometimes 8) weeks
  * Speakers can sometimes be rude and frustrating to work with... this is money we're talking about hehe
  * Just keep both of these things in mind when going through this process
* International speakers will require a wire transfer
  * Make sure you let them know of this via the information packet we send before conference (with all the other reimbursement information)
* Each speaker will need to fill out the Speaker Reimbursement Form”
  * This can be found in [Teams → Finance → Files → Receipts → Speaker Reimbursement](https://indiana.sharepoint.com/:f:/r/sites/O365-TEDxI/Shared%20Documents/Finance/Receipts/Speaker%20Reimbursement?csf=1\&web=1\&e=WTYCQ0) → “Speaker Reimbursement Form”
  * Note: I talked to Karen recently and she said it would be helpful if we convert the completed PDF files into an excel spreadsheet.
    * I think technically IU needs this filled out PDF, so we can’t just turn it into a Microsoft Form that autogenerates an excel file. You might have to do this manually which sort of sucks
* I just sent Karen a zipped folder for each speaker containing their reimbursement form and all their receipts
  * It made it easier for me to send her all the information, and made it easier for Karen to know what belonged to each speaker
  * I recommend renaming each file inside of the zipped folder something like “SpeakerName\_FoodReceipt” or whatever so that it stays organized
* In the email I sent her with the zipped folder, I briefly outlined each speaker’s expenses and whatever additional information they sent me
* Give speakers a deadline to work towards (some like to procrastinate!)
  * I gave them all 2 weeks and said if they didn’t get it to me in time, they just wouldn’t be reimbursed
  * This seemed to work because I got all the reimbursements by the date I set out for
