# 📈 Funding Boards

## IUFB (Indiana University Funding Board)

* I enjoyed working with IUFB this year!
* They gave us $20,000 in total this year! Woohoo!!
* Everyone kept telling me how easy IUFB related things were but no one actually told me what to do, so here’s my guide for you
  * 1\. Application
  * 2\. They review application
  * 3\. They arrange funding pitch time
  * 4\. You do the funding pitch
  * 5\. They adjust ALL your funding numbers (can take up to 4 weeks)
  * 6\. They approve/reject you
  * 7\. You submit all your receipts when you’re done
* IUFB holds these little “Get to know us” events throughout the year. Somehow, I ended up attending 3 of these
  * They were EXTREMELY helpful
    * They literally walked you through how to fill out an application, answered my 948,593 questions, and taught me little tips/tricks to get more money out of them (10/10 recommend by the way)&#x20;
    * They have specific rules about how much can be requested for what types of items, so it’s good to go to the events just to learn this information
* IUFB also have bylaws that are also helpful
  * They outline everything that can/cannot be requested o I don’t suggest reading through the whole thing or anything, but if you ever have a question, check the bylaws before emailing them
* IUFB is student run
  * All your funding pitches will be to students
  * It really takes the pressure off
  * They’re usually very casual and chill which is nice
  * They take forever to respond to emails though (because they’re student run, obviously)
* Funding Pitches
  * They schedule you a 10 minute slot
    * In my experience it usually only takes 7 minutes
    * They are always behind schedule though, so block off 30 minutes for sure
    * No slide deck or anything
      * They literally just pull up your application on the screen behind them
      * You stand in front of the screen
    * There can be anywhere from 7 to 15 of them in the room
      * They’re not intimidating, but the number is just so you know how many handouts to bring
    * Bring handouts!!
    * The first thing you’ll do when you go in is just hand them a nice stack
    * Because you don’t know how many will be there, I suggest printing 15
    * Keep one for yourself though, because no doubt you’ll be pointing to sections to explain things to them
    * They like to hold and read things (it’s probably a preparedness bias thing)
    * Examples of the handouts I’ve taken are in [Teams → Finance → Files → Funding → IUFB](https://indiana.sharepoint.com/:f:/r/sites/O365-TEDxI/Shared%20Documents/Finance/Funding/IUFB?csf=1\&web=1\&e=yn4Y06) → Ending in “Funding Handout”
    * I just made them in Canva, nothing too crazy
* As this is done through BeInvolved, the Director of Finance is the only person who is able to see and submit an application

## OVPR (Office of the Vice Provost of Research)

* Historically (my understanding is at least 3-5 years), they gave us $10,000 in exchange for using a speaker of their choosing
* Normally how that happened was that you emailed Jane and Bethan (they works under the OVPR department), she would set up a Zoom call, you would make a pitch (take the President and Director of Curation to this meeting), and then she would email you with approval/rejection
  * Jane Drake’s Email: [jmdrake@iu.edu](mailto:jmdrake@iu.edu)
  * Bethan Roberts’ Email: [bwr@iu.edu](mailto:bwr@iu.edu)
  * The email I sent them this year is in [Teams → Finance → Files → Funding → OVPR → “OVPR Partnership – Email"](https://indiana.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/sites/O365-TEDxI/Shared%20Documents/Finance/Funding/OVPR/OVPR%20Partnership%20-%20Email.docx?d=w3386a5a16b91401aa2d8f64fecbe3814\&csf=1\&web=1\&e=ncu4bh)
* Any (and all) emails relating to finance this year will be in the TED email in a folder on the left bar under “2023-2024” → “Finance Stuff”
* At some point I’ll make a document outlining the email chain between me and OVPR this year vs what it looked like in the past – it just won’t be ready when I hand this doc to you\[VM1]&#x20;
* In case it’s relevant to you next year, here are more details about how this partnership ran (I consulted Saniya before writing this, so hopefully I remember what she said correctly and it’s accurate!)
  * If OVPR says yes, usually they’re invested in the theme
  * You generally email or meet with them once more with the Director of Curation
  * Curation explains the theme and the type of speaker they’re looking for
  * OVPR comes back with 3-4 IU professors that Curation will pick 1 from (unless they hate all the choices and tell OVPR to try again)
  * Either someone on curation volunteers to work with this professor, or the director will sort of just assign someone to this person
* In case anyone chooses to read this in the future, we didn’t get funding from OVPR during the 2023-2024, but hopefully they’ll partner again with us in the future
