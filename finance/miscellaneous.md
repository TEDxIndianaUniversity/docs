## Photography

* I’m not sure who’s job this actually is, but I co-wrote the email to the photographer this year
* Lucy told me to specify how many photos we wanted and when we wanted these photos so I made sure to do all of that
  * You can find the email I sent in\[VM1]&#x20;

## TEDx Email

* If you’re ever looking for something related to an email I sent, chances are you’ll find it in the folder 2023-2024 → “Finance Stuff”
* Try to send as much stuff as possible from the TED email or cc the TED email to increase transparency
