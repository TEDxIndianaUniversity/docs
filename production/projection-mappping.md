# üìΩÔ∏è Projection Mappping

## Overview

Projection mapping is an amazing way to make a stage (or any venue) more interesting! You can "map" a video onto an object or even change the shape of your screen.&#x20;

## Software

Good project mapping software can cost some money. Personally, I (Reece) like using [MadMapper](https://madmapper.com/madmapper/software), which costs a bit under $50 for 1 month of use. That being said, they have an educational discount, which would get you 30% off.
