## Visual and Historical Research

Think about the theme or topic... What words come to mind? What visuals? What historical periods or cultural elements? What verbs or adjectives? Start in this phase of "just letting your brain steep." After you dump a bunch of words and ideas out onto a paper or whiteboard or document, begin to do some research. Research for stage design can be formal, in the case of historical events, or _very informal_, like scrolling the web for image inspiration. Collect anything that catches your eye and save it for later. (These don't have to be stage designs; for example, saving a photo of a plant or a fanart sketch is totally valid! This is about what inspires you.)

## Thumbnails

Thumbnails are quick-and-dirty sketches that help stage designers express their ideas. Using some of the [research](ideate-and-design-staging.md#visual-and-historical-research) you collected, put together 3-5 sketches of different stage designs. How can you take some of your ideas and put them on a stage? Think outside the box! Don't worry yourself with technical details.

Here's some resources to get you started:

## Digital or Physical Model

Making a model is the last phase of stage design. You can either do this physically or digitally. Physical models are great for understanding spacing in addition to not needing to learn any software. That being said, because they're small and hand-done, they are more time-intensive than digital models, which can also be more details. I (Reece) personally use digital modelling; however, do whatever is best for your team.
