# üèõÔ∏è Making a Model

## Digital or Physical Model

Making a model is the last phase of stage design. You can either do this physically or digitally. Physical models are great for understanding spacing in addition to not needing to learn any software. That being said, because they're small and hand-done, they are more time-intensive than digital models, which can also be more details. I (Reece) personally use digital modelling; however, do whatever is best for your team.
